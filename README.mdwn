# sandboxlib: a lightweight library for running programs/commands in a sandbox

This project is a total work in progress, no documentation yet.

It is being developed as part of the [Baserock] project.

The goal of this library is to provide the sandboxing functionality that is
already present in the build tools [Morph] and [YBD]. We want this new library
to be usable without depending on [linux-user-chroot], so that it can be used
on Mac OS X, and hopefully other platforms too.
