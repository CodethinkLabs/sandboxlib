# sandboxlib: a lightweight library for running programs/commands in a sandbox

This project is a total work in progress, no documentation yet.

It is being developed as part of the [Baserock] project.

The goal of this library is to provide the sandboxing functionality that is
already present in the build tools [Morph] and [YBD]. We want this new library
to be usable without depending on [linux-user-chroot], so that it can be used
on Mac OS X, and hopefully other platforms too.

I have been using the [App Container spec] as a reference during development.
The scope of 'sandboxlib' is different to that of the App Container spec:
'sandboxlib' only deals with a single, isolated sandbox (which may or may
not be a 'container'), where the App Container spec is focused on multiple
containers. However, 'sandboxlib' would be a useful building block for
implementing a complete App Container runtime, and simple App Container images
(.acis) should be runnable with the `run-sandbox` tool directly.
