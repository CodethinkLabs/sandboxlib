# Testing that a sandbox conforms to the App Container spec

The [App Container project] provides an 'ace' package containing a
[validator application for App Container Executors (ACEs)].

If you want to test whether a particular sandbox 'exec' module conforms to the
App Container spec, try this. You'll need a [golang] compiler available, and you
might need to set the `GOPATH` environment variable to point to a path where
you're happy for Go to install dependencies.

First build the `ace-validator-main.aci` and `ace-validator-sidekick.aci` App
Container images.

    git clone git://github.com/appc/spec appc-spec
    cd appc-spec
    appc-spec/ace/build

Then, use the run-sandbox program to run the image:

    run-sandbox appc-spec/ace/build/ace-validator-main.aci
