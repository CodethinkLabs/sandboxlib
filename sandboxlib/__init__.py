'''sandboxlib module.

This module contains multiple 'executor' backends, which must all provide
the same API. A stub version of the API is defined in this file, with
docstrings that describe the different parameters.

def maximum_possible_isolation():
    '''Describe the 'tightest' isolation possible with a specific backend.

    This function returns a dict, with the following keys:

      - mounts
      - network

    Each key maps to a parameter of the run_sandbox() function, and each
    value is a valid value for that parameter.

    Example result:

        {
            'mounts': 'undefined'
            'network': 'isolated'
        }

    You can pass the result directly to a run_sandbox() function directly,
    using the `**` operator to turn it into keyword arguments as in the
    following example:

        isolation_settings = maximum_possible_isolation()
        run_sandbox(root_path, ['echo', 'hello'], **isolation_settings)

                stderr=CAPTURE, stdout=CAPTURE):
    '''Run 'command' in a sandboxed environment.

    Parameters:
      - command: the command to run. Pass a list of parameters rather than
            using spaces to separate them, e.g. ['echo', '"Hello world"'].
      - cwd: the working directory of 'command', relative to 'rootfs_path'.
            Defaults to '/' if "rootfs_path" is specified, and the current
            directory of the calling process otherwise.
      - env: environment variables to set
      - filesystem_root: the path to the root of the sandbox. Defaults to '/',
            which doesn't isolate the command from the host filesystem at all.
      - filesystem_writable_paths: defaults to 'all', which allows the command
            to write to anywhere under 'filesystem_root' that the user of the
            calling process could write to. Backends may accept a list of paths
            instead of 'all', and will prevent writes to any files not under a
            path in that whitelist. If 'none' or an empty list is passed, the
            whole file-system will be read-only. The paths should be relative
            to filesystem_root. This will processed /after/ extra_mounts are
            mounted.
      - mounts: configures mount sharing. Defaults to 'undefined', where no
            no attempt is made to isolate mounts. Backends may support
            'isolated' as well.
      - extra_mounts: a list of locations to mount inside 'rootfs_path',
            specified as a list of tuples of (source_path, target_path, type,
            options). The 'type' and 'options' should match what would be
            specified in /etc/fstab, but a backends may support only a limited
            subset of values. The 'target_path' is relative to filesystem_root
            and will be created before mounting if it doesn't exist.
      - network: configures network sharing. Defaults to 'undefined', where
            no attempt is made to either prevent or provide networking
            inside the sandbox. Backends may support 'isolated' and/or other
            values as well.
      - stdout: whether to capture stdout, or redirect stdout to a file handle.
            If set to sandboxlib.CAPTURE, the function will return the stdout
            data, if not, it will return None for that. If stdout=None, the
            data will be discarded -- it will NOT inherit the parent process's
            stdout, unlike with subprocess.Popen(). Set 'stdout=sys.stdout' if
            you want that.
      - stderr: same as stdout

    Returns:
      a tuple of (exit code, stdout output, stderr output).

    those values will be None in any case.
